Here is a demonstration of the basic terminal commands cd, ls, and cat

## Using cd:
---
### Without arguments:
![Image](cd_no_commands.png)

The cd command changes directory into another folder or directory. If no arguments are given, the computer doesn't know which directory to change into, so it won't produce any output or change the directory

### With directory as argument:
![Image](cd_directory_arg.png)

The prompt now shows up with "lecture1" before the dollar sign because the cd command changed the directory into the directory that was given as the argument, which was the lecture1 folder. 

### With file as argument:
![Image](cd_file_arg.png)

The terminal produces this output because the cd command can only work with directories as arguments. A file is not a directory, so the computer cannot change the directory to a specific file. 

## Using ls: 
---
### Without arguments



## Using cat:
---
